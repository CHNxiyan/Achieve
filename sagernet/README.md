⚠️ **The SagerNet app is looking for a new maintainer**

Due to my physical condition, I may not be able to update SN / plugins in time.

I am looking for a new maintainer for the project. The new maintainer should have a track record of successfully maintaining an open-source project.

Potential maintainers can gain the required experience by contributing to this project. If you are interested, jump in and start contributing.

If you rely on the quality and ongoing maintenance of this package, please get involved by helping to maintain this package or finding people to help maintain the project.

Note for spammers: We never stop maintaining.

### Adding a new language

First and foremost, Android must already support the specific language and locale you want to add.
We cannot work with languages that Android and the SDK do not support, the tools simply break down.
Next, if you are considering adding a country-specific variant of a language (e.g. de-AT), first
make sure that the main language is well maintained (e.g. de). Your contribution might be useful to
more people if you contribute to the existing version of your language rather than the
country-specific variant.

Anyone can create a new language via Weblate.
