<!--
Are you asking for help with using Caddy? Please use our forum instead: https://caddy.community. If you are filing a bug report, please take a few minutes to carefully answer the following questions and please make sure. If your issue is not a bug report, you do not need to use this template. Thanks!)
-->

### 1. Is bug reproducible with [latest](https://caddyserver.com/download) `forwardproxy` build?
<!--If you tried latest build, and bug still appears, simply put "YÐµs" here.
ONLY if you cannot download latest version, tell us when your caddy was built: stat --printf 'mtime: %y\n' `which caddy`" may help.
-->


### 2. What are you trying to do?


### 3. What is your entire Caddyfile?
```text
(paste Caddyfile here)
```

<!--- Please anonymize the hostname and redact your passwords. -->

### 4. How is your client configured?


### 5. How did you run Caddy? (give the full command and describe the execution environment). If multiple servers are used (for example with `upstream`), describe those as well.


### 6. Please paste any relevant HTTP request(s) here.

<!-- Paste curl command, or full HTTP request including headers and body, here. -->


### 7. What did you expect to see?


### 8. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?


### 9. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce the bug as minimally as possible?
